# What are the Carpentries?

--

- "Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain."

--

Data Carpentry: a focus on data management and data analysis, rather than software engineering

--

Library Carpentry 

--

etc.

--

Since January 2018, one organization called "The Carpentries"

---

# The basics


- Volunteer instructors.

--

- Democratically governed non-profit organization

--

- All the materials are freely reusable.

--

- Lessons are community developed.

---

### My SWC history

--

- I knew about the (Matlab!) materials while in grad school

--

- First time I helped was in 2011 (12?)

--

- Certified as an instructor in 2012

--

- Instructor trainer since last year



---

## Why do I do it?

--

- "Self defense"

--

- Best way to learn is by teaching

--

- Teaching is also fun!

--

- I care about the standards of my field

--

- When I was a post-doc, I enjoyed the travel

--

- Brought me to places I wanted to go for career reasons

--

- But also places I just wanted to visit!

--

- Amazing community of practice to be part of

--

- And a tremendously useful network!

## Do you want to get certified as a Carpentries instructor?

--

What it entails:

- 2-day Instructor training workshop 

- May 21st-22nd

- A couple of follow-up assignments

--

[The curriculum](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/):

- Introduce participants to a handful of key research findings and show how they can be used to help people learn better and faster.

- Introduce participants to the teaching practices that have been adopted by the Software and Data Carpentry communities, and the overall philosophy and procedures of both organizations in order to prepare them to teach at Software and Data Carpentry workshops.

---

## Potential benefits:

--

- To run SWC workshops, there needs to be one certified instructor

--

- You can be that person in your next position

--

- Something to write in your teaching statement.

--

- Learn some useful things about teaching?
